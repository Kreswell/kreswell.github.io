Well, I started off strong with my new behavior tracking plan, but then lost my momentum about two weeks in. This is pretty typical. Two weeks is about how long it takes for the "newness" to wear off. I think the lesson here is that I was able to stick to the 30-30-30 plan for about 15 weeks because it was a well-defined amount of time that was short enough to feel finite, but long enough to push through the initial few weeks and into becoming a routine. 

So my new plan is to pick a few things I want to accomplish and set some goals for the total amount done in the next 100 days. The goals should be *un*ambitious but require consistency. 
| Number | Goal | 
|--|--|
| 1,000,000 | steps |
| 100,000 | calories logged |
| 10,000 | words written |
| 1,000 | minutes meditating |
| 100 | chores |
| 10 | pounds lost |
| 1 | big thing |

A few details about these:
- Only days were I log every single thing I eat will count for calorie tracking. My daily goal will be to stay under 2000 calories, at least until I have a better sense of where I need to be to meet my weight loss goal.
- Only words posted here, or otherwise "published," will count.
- The highest priority chore is the dishes. After that are probably laundry and yard work.
- I'm calling my starting weight 196 pounds, so my goal weight is 186 pounds.
- The "big thing" can be any new thing that I've been wanting to do, but 

One hundred days is 14 weeks plus two days (one extra weekend), so today is day 1.

It also helped a lot that I had incentives to track absolutely every day. I wanted complete calorie and weight data with no gaps because I was trying to figure out my true calorie limit for weight loss. Unfortunately, the noise was larger than the signal -- my daily weight fluctuations were often larger than my average day-to-day loss -- and
