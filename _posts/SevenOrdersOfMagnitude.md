Well, I started off strong with my new behavior tracking plan, but then lost my momentum about two weeks in. This is pretty typical. Two weeks is about how long it takes for the "newness" to wear off. I think the lesson here is that I was able to stick to the 30-30-30 plan for about 15 weeks because it was a well-defined amount of time that was short enough to feel finite, but long enough to push through the initial few weeks and into becoming a routine. 

So my new plan is: Pick a few things I want to accomplish in 100 days, and set some goals for the total amount I want to accomplish in that time. The goals should be *un*ambitious but require consistency. 
| Number | Goal | 
|--|--|
| 1,000,000 | steps |
| 100,000 | calories logged |
| 10,000 | words written |
| 1,000 | minutes meditating |
| 100 | chores |
| 10 | pounds lost |
| 1 | new thing |

A few details about these:
- Only days were I log every single thing I eat will count for calorie tracking. My daily goal will be to stay under 2000 calories, at least until I have a better sense of where I need to be to meet my weight loss goal.
- Only words posted here will count.
- The highest priority chore is the dishes. After that are laundry and yard work.
- I'm calling my starting weight 196 pounds, so my goal weight is 186 pounds.

One hundred days is 14 weeks plus two days (one extra weekend), so today is day 1.

It also helped a lot that I had incentives to track absolutely every day. I wanted complete calorie and weight data with no gaps because I was trying to figure out my true calorie limit for weight loss. Unfortunately, the noise was larger than the signal -- my daily weight fluctuations were often larger than my average day-to-day loss -- and
