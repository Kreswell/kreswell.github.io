Well, I started off strong with my new behavior tracking plan, but then lost my momentum about two weeks in. This is pretty typical. Two weeks is about how long it takes for the "newness" to wear off. I think the lesson here is that I was able to stick to the 30-30-30 plan for about 15 weeks because it was a well-defined amount of time that was short enough to feel finite, but long enough to push through the initial few weeks and into becoming a routine. 

So my new plan is: Pick a few things I want to accomplish in 100 days, and set some goals that are *un*ambitious but require consistency. 
| Number | Goal | 
|--|--|
| 1,000,000 | steps |
| 100,000 | calories logged |
| 10,000 | words written |
| 1,000 | minutes meditating |
| 100 | chores completed |
| 10 | pounds lost |
| 1 | big accomplishment |



One hundred days is a nice number because it's 14 weeks plus two days (one extra weekend).

It also helped a lot that I had incentives to track absolutely every day. I wanted complete calorie and weight data with no gaps because I was trying to figure out my true calorie limit for weight loss. Unfortunately, the noise was larger than the signal -- my daily weight fluctuations were often larger than my average day-to-day loss -- and
