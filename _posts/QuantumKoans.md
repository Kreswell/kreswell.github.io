Quantum mechanics is very counter-intuitive, but intuition is [learned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intuition). So maybe it's possible to learn new intuitions that makes quantum mechanics make more sense. The best way to train our intuition is through direct experience, but this is difficult, if not impossible, for extremely macroscopic creatures (around 10<sup>29</sup> particles) like us.
