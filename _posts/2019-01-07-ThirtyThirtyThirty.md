Last year, my wife and I ran in a few 5k's. I had never run in any before. I was surprised by how quickly I improved when I really started running on a regular basis. My best time was 32:29. That got me started thinking, "I bet if I keep working on it, I could get under 30:00." Then I started thinking, "I bet it would be a lot easier if I weren't carrying so much extra weight."

Most of my life, I've been pretty careless about my weight and eating habits. Naturally, that means my weight has been gradually creeping up for a long time, to the point that I'm now over 200 lbs. For someone who's only 5'7" that's pretty big. I've had several false starts with trying to lose weight, but I've never made much progress. So here's my new plan:

# 30-30-30
I decided to set three clear, finite, reasonable goals for myself:
1. Lose 30 pounds.
2. Run a 5k in under 30 minutes.
3. Achieve both in 30 weeks or less.

That's about seven months. More specifically, I plan to:
## 1. Get my 10,000 steps every day.
Not necessarily by running, although I probably will need to do at least a little running most days to get my step goal. On days when I just drive to work, sit at my desk, and drive home, I barely break 3,000 unless I do something extra. I may decide to up my step goal later, but for now I'm going with the standard 10,000.

## 2. Track my calories every day.
Even if I go over, the most important thing, at least at first, is that I establish a habit of recording absolutely everything I eat.

## 3. Share my progress.
I need to be accountable to someone other than myself, or else I'm going to abandon this plan in about 2-3 weeks. So I'm posting it here.
