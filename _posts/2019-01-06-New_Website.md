I decided to move my blog again. Without going into an overly long explanation, I wanted a site that was more of a personal website than a simple blog. I wanted to be able to directly edit the code, easily format math equations, and do a few other fun things that WordPress doesn't support (at least not easily on their free version).

I started the process of moving over to GitHub a few months ago, but it took me a while to find the time and resources to figure out how to set this site up nicely. Ultimately, I found [an example GitHub Pages site repository](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and shamelessly copied it. By the way, if you happen to find something broken, or that I forgot to update from the original example, let me know. For now I'm going to leave up my test pages, for fun and for my own reference.

My old WordPress blog can be found [here](https://adphdblog.wordpress.com/), and my really old WordPress blog is [here](https://kreswell.wordpress.com/).
