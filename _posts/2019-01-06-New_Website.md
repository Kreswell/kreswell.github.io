I decided to move my blog again. Without going into an overly long explanation, I wanted a site that was more of a personal website than a simple blog. I wanted to be able to directly edit the code, easily format math equations, and do a few other fun things that WordPress doesn't support (at least not easily on their free version).

I started the process of moving over to GitHub a few months ago, but it took me a while to find the time and resources to figure out how to set this site up nicely. Ultimately, I found [an example GitHub Pages site repository](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and shamelessly copied it. By the way, if you happen to find something broken, or that I forgot to update from the original example, let me know. I haven't written the readme file or the about page yet, but I didn't want to get too bogged down in the setup and never get started writing content.

My old WordPress blog can be found [here](https://adphdblog.wordpress.com/), and my really old WordPress blog is [here](https://kreswell.wordpress.com/).
