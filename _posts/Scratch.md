Well I've had a pretty unproductive week. And this is a week when I really needed to get some stuff done!

Having ADHD means having days, or even whole weeks, when I know I need to get things done, I have every intention of getting things done, but nothing gets done.

One of the most important things that I've recently come to understand about ADHD is that there's always a reason why I'm procrastinating. And the reason isn't "because I'm a slacker." There is some specific hang-up that's stopping me from moving forward. Identifying what exactly the problem is can often be very difficult. And it often still takes me a while to realize that I've fallen into an "avoidance rut." But it's been such a breakthrough for me to understand that, if I'm procrastinating, I need to step back and try to pin down exactly what the hang-up is. Just trying to "buckle down" (as my dad would put it) isn't going to accomplish anything.
