Well I've had a pretty unproductive week. And this is a week when I really needed to get some stuff done!

Having ADHD means having days, or even whole weeks, when I know I need to get things done, I have every intention of getting things done, but nothing gets done.

One of the most important things that I've recently come to understand about ADHD is that there's always a reason why I'm procrastinating. And the reason isn't "because I'm a slacker." There is some specific hang-up that's stopping me from moving forward. Identifying what exactly the problem is can be very difficult. And it often still takes me a while to realize that I've fallen into an "avoidance rut." But it's been such a breakthrough for me to understand that, if I'm procrastinating, I need to step back and try to pin down exactly what the hang-up is. Trying to force myself to just "buckle down" (as my dad would put it) is only going to push me more into avoidance.

This week there's been a lot going on at work and in my personal life, but I think the main sticking point has been this blog.

For years, I've been wanting to do more writing. I've always wanted to be more involved in science communication. In fact, I think I'd like to make it the focus of my career, if the opportunities arise. But even more than that, I need to write for my own sake. I usually have a lot going on in my brain, and it's usually a tangled mess of a few hundred different thought fragments. Writing helps me get these threads out of my head and into a more concrete form where I can start to untangle them. So I set myself the goal of writing 10,000 words in 100 days, with the intention of keeping the posts very short and very frequent, to try to create a habit of writing regularly. 

Since I want to write (semi-)professionally about physics and math, I've been trying to keep the focus of my current posts on those topics. But I think that, instead, I need to give myself permission to write about *whatever*. I have a lot I want to say about physics and math, but that can wait. For now, I just need to write about anything and everything that comes out, until it becomes such a habit that it feels weird to have a day when I don't do any writing.
