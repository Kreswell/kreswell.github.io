Well I've had a pretty unproductive week. And this is a week when I really needed to get some stuff done!

Having ADHD means having days, or even whole weeks, when I know I need to get things done, I have every intention of getting things done, but nothing gets done.

One of the most important things that I've recently come to understand about ADHD is that there's always a reason why I'm procrastinating. And the reason isn't "because I'm a slacker." There is some specific hang-up that's stopping me from moving forward. Identifying what exactly the problem is can often be very difficult.
