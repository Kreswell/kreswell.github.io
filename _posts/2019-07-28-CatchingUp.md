Multiple posts today. I didn’t post over the weekend, but there are things I was planning on putting in those posts, so I’m going to write them retroactively.

Goal updates:
- Track calories this week, and stay within the 2190 calorie limit.
- Keep doing stretches. They do seem to be helping my plantar fascia. The suggested amount is six reps (30-60 seconds each) of three different stretches six times a day. That’s 2-3 hours per day of just stretching (doing both legs), which is insane. But I’ll keep doing as much as I can and see how close I can get to that level.
- Post 100-300 words per day. That’s based on aiming for just barely more than this past week’s average.

There are lot’s of goals I want to add to the list, but I don’t want to try to take on too many things at once, so I’ll go with these and re-evaluate next week.
