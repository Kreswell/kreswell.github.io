Complex numbers have a reputation of being *bizarre* or *other-worldly*. I blame the name. I mean, if you call $\sqrt{-1}$ the *imaginary* unit, then of course people are going to think of it as belonging to some kind of weird fantasy realm of mathematics. When, really, $\sqrt{-1}$ is no less bizarre than $\sqrt{2}$.  

Let's think about $\sqrt{2}$, or as I prefer to say (the *better* way of writing it), $2^{\frac{1}{2}}$. The algebra problem

$$
	x^2 = n
$$

has a nice solution for $n \in \{0,1,4,9,16,\dots\}$. But for other values of $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we don't have obvious answers. We have to *invent* new numbers to
