Complex numbers have a reputation of being *bizarre* or *other-worldly*. I blame the name. I mean, if you call $\sqrt{-1}$ the *imaginary* unit, then of course people are going to think of it as belonging to some kind of weird fantasy realm of mathematics. When, really, $\sqrt{-1}$ is no less bizarre than $\sqrt{2}$.  

Let's think about $\sqrt{2}$, or as I prefer to say (the *better* way of writing it), $2^{\frac{1}{2}}$. The algebra problem

$$
	x^2 = 4
$$

Has a nice solution: 2 or -2, but when the number on the right-hand side isn't a perfect square, we have to *invent* new numbers to solve the equation.
