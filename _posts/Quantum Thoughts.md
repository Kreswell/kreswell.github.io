Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. I've tried several times to start writing up my current best understanding of it, but instead I keep getting sucked into reading more articles and Wikipedia pages about group representations, projection valued measures, decoherence, delayed choice quantum erasers, and so on. I think the problem is, I'm not sure where to start, and I'm really not sure where I'm going to end up.

So let me start by listing the principles that *I think* are sufficient for deriving quantum mechanics. I haven't worked through all of the details yet, so we'll see.

0. The words *observation*, *measurement*, and *interaction* are synonyms.
1. Relativity: There is no preferred or "God given" coordinate system.
2. Finite specificity: Any observable can only be measured or specified up to finite precision in finite time. This is an inherent property of real numbers, and therefore an inherent property of physical observables.

I called the first one the "zeroth" principle because it's basically just terminology, and it's sort of a corollary to 1, but it still seems worth mentioning in itself. Number 2 is where nearly all of the "quantum weirdness" comes from, namely the probabilistic nature of QM, and *I think* (I haven't worked through it rigorously yet), the complex analytic nature of wave functions and observable operators (and therefore the wave-particle duality). It's also probably the hardest one to swallow conceptually, and the one I haven't seen mentioned by any other derivation or interpretation of QM. Which is kind of surprising to me since it follows fairly obviously from basic measure theory (which I realize you probably haven't heard of, but any theorist would be familiar with it). And it should give us a very natural way to completely eliminate "hidden variables" as a concept, so we don't even have to worry about them.

There's a **whole lot** to work through, and it will get pretty mathy. If I decide to dive straight into the deep end, the next step is to look at
