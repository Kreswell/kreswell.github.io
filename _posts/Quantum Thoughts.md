Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. I've tried several times to start writing up my current best understanding of it, but instead I keep getting sucked into reading more articles and Wikipedia pages about group representations, projection valued measures, decoherence, delayed choice quantum erasers, and so on. I think the problem is, I'm not sure where to start, and I really don't know where I'm going to end up.
