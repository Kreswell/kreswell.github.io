Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. There's an old aphorism about quantum mechanics, . I've tried several times to start writing up my current best understanding of it, but instead I keep getting sucked into reading more articles and Wikipedia pages about group representations, projection valued measures, decoherence, delayed choice quantum erasers, and so on.
