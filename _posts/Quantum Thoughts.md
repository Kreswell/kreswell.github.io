Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. I've tried several times to start writing up my current best understanding of it, but instead I keep getting sucked into reading more articles and Wikipedia pages about group representations, projection valued measures, decoherence, delayed choice quantum erasers, and so on. I think the problem is, I'm not sure where to start, and I really don't know where I'm going to end up.

So let me start by listing some of the concepts that seem to be key to understanding quantum mechanics.
1. Relativity.
2.
