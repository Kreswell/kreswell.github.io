Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. I've tried several times to start writing up my current best understanding of it, but instead I keep getting sucked into reading more articles and Wikipedia pages about group representations, projection valued measures, decoherence, delayed choice quantum erasers, and so on. I think the problem is, I'm not sure where to start, and I really don't know where I'm going to end up.

So let me start by listing some of the concepts that seem to be key to understanding quantum mechanics.

0. The words *observation*, *measurement*, and *interaction* are synonyms.
1. Relativity: There is no preferred or "God given" coordinate system.
2. Finite specificity: Any observable can only be measured or specified up to finite precision in finite time. This is an inherent property of real numbers, and therefore an inherent property of physical observables.

I called the first one the "zeroth" principle because it's basically just terminology, and it's sort of a corollary to #1, but I still felt like
