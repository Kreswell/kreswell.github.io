Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. I've been spending a lot of time (that I should probably be spending working on data analysis) reading, thinking, and attempting to write about it. Although every time I start writing up my current understanding, I get sucked into reading more articles and Wikipedia pages about group representations, operator spaces, projection valued measures, and whatever else.
