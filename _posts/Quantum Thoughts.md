Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. I've been spending a lot of time (that I should probably be spending working on data analysis) reading, thinking, and attempting to write about it. I've tried several times to start writing up my current best understanding of it, but instead I keep getting sucked into reading more articles and Wikipedia pages about group representations, operator spaces, projection valued measures, delayed choice quantum erasers, and whatever else.
