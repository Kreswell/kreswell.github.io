Lately I've been a bit obsessed with the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. I've tried several times to start writing up my current best understanding of it, but instead I keep getting sucked into reading more articles and Wikipedia pages about group representations, projection valued measures, decoherence, delayed choice quantum erasers, and so on. I think the problem is, I'm not sure where to start, and I'm really not sure where I'm going to end up.

So let me start by listing the principles that *I think* are sufficient for deriving quantum mechanics. I haven't worked through all of the details yet, so we'll see.

0. The words *observation*, *measurement*, and *interaction* are synonyms.
1. Relativity: There is no preferred or "God given" coordinate system.
2. Finite specificity: Any observable can only be measured or specified up to finite precision in finite time. This is an inherent property of real numbers, and therefore an inherent property of physical observables.
3. Non-essentiality: [Things in themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself) doesn't exist, or at least are completely unknowable. To quote John Wheeler "No phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon."

I called the first one the "zeroth" principle because it's basically just terminology, and it's sort of a corollary to 1 and 3, but it still seems worth mentioning in itself. Number 2 is where nearly all of the "quantum weirdness" comes from including the probabilistic nature of QM. It's also, I think, the hardest one to swallow, and the only one I haven't seen mentioned by
