Elementary particles come in two types: [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi) and [bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Nath_Bose). They are distinguished by their spin.

Spin is weird. It's the most purely quantum mechanical property of subatomic particles, in the sense that there's no good way to visualize it. Ordinary macroscopic things just don't have a property quite like spin. Although, they do have properties *sort of* like spin that can help us get the general idea.

Spin is the *intrinsic angular momentum* of a particle, which is, sort of, the "spinniness" of an object. In classical physics, the angular momentum of an object moving in a circle is (simplified)

$$ L = mvR $$

Where $m$ is mass, $v$ is velocity, and $R$ is the radius of the circle of motion. ($L$ is the standard letter to use for angular momentum. Don't ask me why. I don't know.) And spin has the same dimensions: $mass \times velocity \times distance$. Except that elementary particles don't have structure. They don't have parts. So *there's nothing there to spin!* Yet, somehow they still have this "twistyness" as an intrinsic property.

I like to think of spin as a sort of "directionality" or "pointedness." Here's what I mean: If you have a spin detector ([they involve magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment)) and send some electrons through it (spin $^1/_2$
