Elementary particles come in two types: [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi) and [bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Nath_Bose). They are distinguished by their spin.

Spin is weird. It's the most purely quantum mechanical property of subatomic particles, in the sense that there's no good way to visualize it. Ordinary macroscopic things just don't have a property quite like spin. Although, they do have properties *sort of* like spin that can help us get the general idea.

Spin is the *intrinsic angular momentum* of a particle, which is, sort of, the "spinniness" of an object. In classical physics, the angular momentum of an object moving in a circle is (simplified)
