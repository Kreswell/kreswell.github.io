Well, I ended up taking the weekend off from basically everything. I kind of needed to because I got so deep into this [pointless topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_topology) stuff that I had a hard time focusing on the work I need to be doing for my job. Doing a deep dive into some really abstract math like this can certainly be worthwhile. But I've gotten lost in it, both in the sense that I'm spending too much time on it, and in the sense that I'm hitting my limit of productive learning from just the sources currently available to me (mainly Wikipedia pages and the like).

So let's take a quick break, and I'll get back to it soon. Maybe I'll try to knock out a few short posts on other topics first.
