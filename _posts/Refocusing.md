Well, I ended up taking the weekend off from basically everything. I kind of needed to because I got so deep into this [pointless topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_topology) stuff that I had a hard time focusing on the work I need to be doing for my job. Also, it's easy for me to fall so deep down the rabbit hole of trying to understand a mathematical concept like this, that I lose track of *why* I was diving into it in the first place.
