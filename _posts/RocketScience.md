Alright, everyone, take out your [envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation). We're going to do some light rocket science.

I've been reading [*Leviathan Wakes*](https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Wakes-James-S-Corey/dp/0316129089), the first book in the series that *The Expanse* is based on (I haven't seen any of the show, so no spoilers, please). The setting is a few hundred years in the future. Humanity has colonized the solar system. Travel between the various planets, moons, and asteroids is accomplished in space ships that can sustain accelerations around 1g for weeks, or even months, at a time.
