Alright, everyone, take out your [envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation). We're going to do some light rocket science.

I've been reading [*Leviathan Wakes*](https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Wakes-James-S-Corey/dp/0316129089), the first book in the series that *The Expanse* is based on (I haven't seen any of the show, so no spoilers, please). The setting is a few hundred years in the future. Humanity has colonized the solar system. Travel between the various planets, moons, and asteroids is accomplished in space ships that can sustain accelerations around 1[g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force) for weeks, or even months, at a time[<sup>1</sup>](#<div>).
