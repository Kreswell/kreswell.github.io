I’ll be honest. I really only want to start a group for physicists/scientists with ADHD for my own benefit. But I figure if it benefits me, it will probably benefit other people too. So here’s what I’m hoping to get out of it.

### Awareness
Of each other.

As I mentioned before, I just don’t know who else is out there is working in research while dealing with ADHD. It would be nice to know some other people in a similar situation as me.

Also, I’ve seen it asked whether it’s even possible for someone with ADHD to [be a scientist]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/9xc4ut/can_someone_with_inattentive_adhd_be_a_scientist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/9xc4ut/can_someone_with_inattentive_adhd_be_a_scientist/)) or [get a PhD]([https://www.quora.com/Is-pursuing-a-PhD-degree-a-good-idea-for-people-with-ADD-ADHD](https://www.quora.com/Is-pursuing-a-PhD-degree-a-good-idea-for-people-with-ADD-ADHD)). I think it would be great to have an organized way for me, and others, to say, “Hi, right here. I did it.”

### Understanding ADHD
That is, understanding **our** ADHD.

There has been a lot of progress in understanding ADHD in the last few decades. I’ve learned a lot about it in just the last two years, and it helped me immensely in dealing with it and talking about it. I want to keep learning about the current state of knowledge about it. What better group to do that with than a bunch of other scientists with ADHD?

### Support
That’s actually helpful.

ADHD isn’t really a D of A or H. It’s [an impairment of specific executive functions]([https://www.additudemag.com/7-executive-function-deficits-linked-to-adhd/](https://www.additudemag.com/7-executive-function-deficits-linked-to-adhd/)). The best (only?) way I’ve found to manage these impairments is externally, by having external structures, motivations, and reminders. And the best source of this external structure is another person. I’m not sure what sort of external peer support would work best, but I think if some of us got together, we could start trying to figure it out.
