Quantum mechanics, when viewed as a [mathematical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_theory), can be thought of as the theory of observation and measurement (no

Let's take a minute to really think about the nature of observation and measurement. I know that sounds really dull, but the payoff will hopefully be a better understanding of quantum mechanics.

To be able to talk about observation, we also need to talk about "thingness" because they are *dual* to each other, in the sense that one isn't well-defined without the other. There's no observation without an observed object, and things are only knowable through their observable properties. By the way, if my abstract discussion of a "thing" is too abstract, then you can picture whatever you like to make it more concrete: a particle, a ball, a teapot, an amoeboid blob, etc.

To say a thing is "a *single* thing" implies a few things about it. 
1. **Locality**
There is somewhere that it is and somewhere that it *isn't*. Furthermore, this "where it is" is **bounded** and **connected**.
2. **Unitarity**
It's always somewhere. The thing doesn't suddenly pop into or out of existence. Another way to say this is, if we look everywhere, we're always guaranteed to find it.
3. **Continuity**
Small changes in time imply small changes in location. It doesn't suddenly jump from one location to another.

To be clear, these are statements about *what we see when we look for it*. That is, these are statements about observations, and therefore statements about observable properties. I've been talking here about *location*, but the same rules hold for any other property: color, shape, orientation, charge, etc. But location seems like the most concrete and easily visualized property.

It's important to note that we didn't say where it's *at* but where it's *in*. This is a subtle distinction that will be very important later. Also, continuity doesn't imply that we can make any definite statements about where something is between any two observations. It only implies that if two observations are sufficiently close in time, then the observed locations will be close, in some sense.

We can relax these three properties, but we start to lose our understanding of it being the *same*, *single* *thing*. There are things that we understand to be infinite in extent, electromagnetic fields, for example. But the observables associated with such fields are always localized.
