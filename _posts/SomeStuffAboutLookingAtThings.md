Let's take a minute to really think about the nature of observation and measurement. I know that sounds really dull, but the payoff will hopefully be a better understanding of quantum mechanics.

To be able to talk about observation, we also need to talk about "thingness" because they are *dual* to each other, in the sense that one isn't well-defined without the other. There's no observation without an observed object, and things are only knowable through their observable properties. By the way, if my abstract discussion of a "thing" is too abstract, then you can picture whatever you like to make it more concrete: a particle, a ball, a teapot, an amoeboid blob, etc.

To say a thing is "a *single* thing" implies a few things about it. 
1. **Locality**
There is somewhere that it is and somewhere that it *isn't*. Furthermore, this "where it is" is **bounded** and **connected**.
2. **Unitarity**
It's always somewhere. The thing doesn't suddenly pop into or out of existence. Another way to say this is, if we look everywhere, we're always guaranteed to find it.
3. **Continuity**
Small changes in time imply small changes in location. It doesn't suddenly jump from one location to another.

To be clear, these are statements about *what we see when we look for it*. It's important to note that we didn't say where it's *at* but where it's *in*. Also, continuity doesn't imply that if we see the thing in one location at one time, and in another location at another time, then it was at some *particular* location in
