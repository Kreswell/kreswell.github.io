Let's take a minute to really think about the nature of observation and measurement. I know that sounds really dull, but the payoff will hopefully be a better understanding of quantum mechanics.

To be able to talk about observation, we also need to talk about "thingness" because they are *dual* to each other, in the sense that one isn't well-defined without the other. There's no observation without an observed object, and things are only knowable through their observable properties. By the way, if my abstract discussion of a "thing" is too abstract, then you can picture whatever you like to make it more concrete: a particle, a ball, a teapot, an amoeboid blob, etc.

To say a thing is *a single thing* implies a few things about it. To be clear, these are statements about *what we see when we look for it*.
1. **Locality**
There is somewhere that it is and somewhere that it *isn't*. Furthermore, this "where it is" is **bounded** and **connected**.
2. **Continuity of motion**
