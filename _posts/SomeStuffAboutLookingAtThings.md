Let's take a minute to really think about the nature of observation and measurement. I know that sounds really dull, but the payoff will hopefully be a better understanding of quantum mechanics.

To be able to talk about observation, we also need to talk about "thingness" because they are *dual* to each other, in the sense that one isn't well-defined without the other. There's no observation without an observed object, and things are only knowable through their observable properties. By the way, if my abstract discussion of a "thing" is too abstract, then you can picture whatever you like to make it more concrete: a particle, a ball, a teapot, an amoeboid blob, etc.

To say a thing is, well *a thing*, implies a few things about it:
1. Boundedness.
There is somewhere that it is and somewhere that it *isn't*. And this "where it is" bounded. We should be able to draw a finite-volume box that completely encloses it. (This condition can, and will, be relaxed a little when we change from talking about where it *is* to where it *could be*.)
