Let's take a minute to really think about the nature of observation and measurement. I know that sounds really dull, but the payoff will hopefully be a better understanding of quantum mechanics.

To be able to talk about observation, we also need to talk about "thingness" because they are *dual* to each other, in the sense that one isn't well-defined without the other. There's no observation without an observed object, and things are only knowable through their observable properties.

To say a thing is, well *a thing*, implies a few things about it:
1. Locality.
There is somewhere that it is and somewhere that it *isn't*. Even for things that we understand to exist everywhere in the universe -- electromagnetic fields, for example -- we only observe them vi
