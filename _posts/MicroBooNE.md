I'm currently involved with two particle physics experiments at Fermilab: Mu2e and MicroBooNE. Since I need to prepare an overview talk about MicroBooNE for an upcoming meeting, I thought this would be a great chance to talk about it here.

MicroBooNE is a neutrino experiment. Neutrinos are elementary particles that are extremely abundant, but also extremely light and charge-neutral, so they don't interact much. They come in three "flavors" named after their charged cousins: the electron, muon, and tau.
