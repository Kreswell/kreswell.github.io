I've been thinking about math a lot lately. 

OK, that's pretty much always true, but there are some particular mathematical concepts that I've been thinking about a lot that I don't understand nearly as well as I'd like to. While digging into it, I realized I could really stand to review a lot of stuff from calculus II-III, differential equations, complex analysis -- basically all the stuff from my undergrad math courses 20+ years ago. (Holy crap, I'm old!) These topics are one step above the level of the stuff I taught as a TA (pre-calc, calc I, first year physics), and two or three steps below the stuff covered in my grad courses, so some of it I really haven't touched (at least, not directly) since I first took the course.

So, I think I'm going to start a series where I (semi-)teach these concepts. Now let me be clear. I'm doing this mainly for my own benefit, so I'm not sure how pedagogical these posts will be for other readers. But I know that for me to be detailed and thorough enough for this project to be beneficial to myself, I need to know (or at least pretend) that someone else will be reading it. It probably won't be very accessible to readers not already familiar with the math I'm talking about. But if you happen to read any of it and have any thoughts, please give me feedback! Let me know if I say anything that's particularly enlightening, confusing, or just plain wrong. It will help me stay motivated to keep working on it. And one of my biggest problems with writing has always been consistency.

I don't know how far I'll go or how often I'll post. I'm going to start with a quick(?) review of some key ideas from pre-calc and calc I, and move on from there. And I'll probably vary a lot with which things I'll dive into deeply, and which things I'll blow past. The stuff I've been wanting to understand better falls within the topics of functional analysis, topology, and such. So I'm hoping to get all the way up to that point. We'll see.
