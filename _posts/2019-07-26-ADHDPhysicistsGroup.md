I want to start a group for physicists with ADHD, or maybe, more generally, for scientists and researchers with ADHD.

Physics is basically the coolest thing ever, but *doing* physics **sucks** when you have ADHD. It's mostly sitting at a computer, staring at analysis code for hours, working towards an often loosely defined goal, with a very long deadline (also often loosely defined), alone. I think a lot of people in physics love having that kind of autonomy, but for someone with ADHD, it may be the worst possible job. But, I mean, come on, I can't not do physics. It's *physics*! So I've got to figure out some way to deal with all my ADHD crap so I can keep working.

It would be great to meet some other people in this field who are dealing with the same sort of ADHD crap. I know there *are* others. There may even be a few other people at Fermilab. But I haven't actually met any of them (at least not that I know of).
