Quantum mechanics is very counter-intuitive, but intuition is [learned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/intuition). So maybe it's possible to learn new intuitions that makes quantum mechanics make more sense. 

The best way to train our intuition is through direct experience, but this is difficult, if not impossible, for extremely macroscopic creatures (around 10<sup>29</sup> particles) like us. So instead we'll look at a few parables, riddles, and (apparent) paradoxes. For now, I'll just put them out there to think about and discuss them in detail later.

### Zeno's Paradoxes
The most famous ones are the [paradoxes of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Paradoxes_of_motion), but equally (if not more) important to building a quantum intuition is the *paradox of place*.

### Number Darts
Imagine throwing a dart (with a geometric point tip) at the [real number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line). Suppose you aim at $$\pi$$. What's the probability that you hit $$\pi$$ *exactly*? How will you know if you hit $$\pi$$ *exactly*? Suppose you try to cheat and stick the dart *exactly* on $$\pi$$ by hand. Is that even possible? What if instead of aiming at $$\pi$$, you aim at $$2$$. Is that different, or is $$2$$ just as "easy to hit" as $$\pi$$? 

### Emptiness
I'm just going to point you towards the Mahayana Buddhist concepts of [sunyata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81) or [emptiness](https://www.learnreligions.com/sunyata-or-emptiness-450191) and dependent origination, and the Kantian concept of the *unknowability* of the [thing-in-itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself).

### Quotes
Finally, let me list a few quotes that might get us thinking in the right direction.

#### George Box
> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

#### David Mermin
> Correlations have physical reality; that which they correlate does not.

#### John Wheeler
> No phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon.

> \[The Universe does not\] exist, out there independent of all acts of observation.

#### Albert Einstein
> The photon has traveled only _one_ route. It travels only one route. but it travels both routes: it travels both routes, but it travels only one route. What nonsense!

#### Niels Bohr
> Einstein, stop telling God what to do.
