This is supposed to be a blog about physics, among other things, so it's about time I wrote some posts about physics. Since I'm a particle physicist, and since I'm trying this format where I write a short post every day, I figured I'd get the ball rolling by running through the standard model over the next week or two.

The Standard Model of Partiis sort of the "periodic table of elementary particles." Well, a theorist would say it's really the theory behind those particles and their interactions. But let's just focus on what the particles and interactions are. The theory [gets a bit mathy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement).

As you can see, the list of known particles is pretty short. However, there are a whole bunch of different *categories* of particles. This is where things can get pretty confusing, if for no other reason than because of all the terminology. But those categories are, in a sense, the defining features of the particles, so that's what I'll focus on.

But before I can talk about the most important categorical difference, I've got to say a little bit about the bizarre quantum mechanical property called *spin*. So that's what we'll get into next time.
