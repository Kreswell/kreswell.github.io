This is supposed to be a blog about physics, among other things, so it's about time I wrote a post about physics. Since I'm a particle physicist, and since I'm trying this format where I write a short post every day, I figured I'd get the ball rolling by running through the standard model over the next week or two.

The standard model is sort of the "periodic table of elementary particles." Well, a theorist would say it's really the theory behind those particles and their interactions. But let's just focus on what the particles and interactions are. The theory [gets a bit mathy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement).

As you can see, the list of known particles is pretty short. However, as you can see, there are a whole bunch of different categories of particles. This is where things can get pretty confusing, simp
