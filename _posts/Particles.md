This is supposed to be a blog about physics, among other things, so it's about time I wrote a post about physics. Since I'm a particle physicist, and since I'm trying this format where I write a short post every day, I figured I'd get the ball rolling by running through the standard model.

The standard model is sort of the "periodic table of elementary particles,"
