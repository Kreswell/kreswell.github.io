Well, I started off strong with my new behavior tracking plan, but then lost my momentum about two weeks in. This is pretty typical. Two weeks is about how long it takes for the "newness" to wear off. I think the lesson here is that I was able to stick to the 30-30-30 plan for about 15 weeks because it was a well-defined amount of time that was short enough to feel finite, but long enough to push through the initial few weeks and into becoming a routine. 

So for my new plan I'm setting a time frame of 100 days, which is 14 weeks plus an extra weekend. The goals should be *un*ambitious but require consistency, and will be a total number for the entire 100 days. Since 100 is a power of 10, I decided to make all of the goals a power of 10. 
| Number | Goal | 
|--|--|
| 1,000,000 | steps |
| 100,000 | calories logged |
| 10,000 | words written |
| 1,000 | minutes meditating |
| 100 | chores |
| 10 | pounds lost |
| 1 | big thing |

A few details about these:
- Only days were I log every single thing I eat will count for calorie tracking. My daily goal will be to stay under 2000 calories, at least until I have a better sense of where I need to be to meet my weight loss goal.
- Only words posted here, or otherwise "published," will count.
- The highest priority chore is the dishes. After that are probably laundry and yard work.
- I'm calling my starting weight 196 pounds, so my goal weight is 186 pounds.
- The "big thing" should be anything that's big and/or new enough to feel like an accomplishment on this time scale, but is still definitely one thing such as starting the "ADHD scientists" group, or creating some sort of recorded media content like a video or podcast.

Yesterday, August 10, was day 1, which makes November 17 day 100. The tracking spreadsheet is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQB1KkVJFVSpi6sP5w3Xgkvu43DZ61ABtgkjUWywLQQEnmzycT9cLMQlLDRPbY2qu1vXtUuM8TkkCCo/pubhtml). I'm going to try to keep most of my posts on this blog related to the topics listed on the front page, so I'm only going to post about it once per week at most. But if you notice me slacking, feel free to bug me about it!
