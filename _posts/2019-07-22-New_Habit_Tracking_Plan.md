## Monday, July 22
At the beginning of the year, I started my “30-30-30” plan. I managed to make it to around “15-15-15” before falling out of the habit. Even though I only made it about halfway to my goal, I still consider it hugely successful. I managed to lose over 15 pounds! I’d never successfully lost a significant amount of weight before.
