OK, I need to write this stuff out for the sake of my own understanding. Please excuse my (mathematically formal) language. 

# A Pointless Reconstruction of the Real Numbers
Let $X$ be a space. We're going to construct several different structures on $X$. Two of these are order structures, so we need to be careful with notation to avoid confusion.

## Conceptual Motivation
Typically we think of measurement as assigning a real number to a real-world phenomenon. Thus, a measurement function is a [surjection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function) from the set of observable states onto (an interval of) $\mathbb{R}$. However, this isn't really how it works. [Almost all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_all) real numbers are non-[computable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number), so almost all possible measurement outcomes cannot be specified in a finite number of steps, nor can it be completed in finite time. Indeed, we have it even worse than this because even if (in some measurement basis) a real-world observable $x$ takes a value from the computable numbers (a rational value, for example), this cannot be determined in finite time. It would still take an infinite number of steps to unambiguously distinguish the value of $x$ from the (uncountably many) other real numbers arbitrarily close to $x$.

In more familiar terms, if I want to write down an arbitrary real number in decimal notation *exactly*, I have to write down *all* of its digits. This, of course, cannot be done in finite time. Thus, if I want to measure some real-world quantity *exactly*, such as the distance between to points, I have to determine *all* of the significant digits of the measurement. Even if the quantity has some "nice" value -- $2$ cm, for example --
