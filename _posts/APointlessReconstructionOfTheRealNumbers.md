OK, I need to write this stuff out for the sake of my own understanding. Please excuse my (mathematically formal) language. 

# A Pointless Reconstruction of the Real Numbers
Let $X$ be a space. We're going to construct several different structures on $X$. Two of these are order structures, so we need to be careful with notation to avoid confusion.

## Conceptual Motivation
Typically we think of measurement as assigning a real number to a real-world phenomenon. However, this isn't really how it works. Almost all real numbers are non-[computable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable_number), so any [choice function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_function) that is [surjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function) on $\mathbb{R}$ cannot be specified in a finite number of steps, nor can it be completed in finite time. Indeed, we have it even worse than this because even if (in some measurement basis) a real-world observable takes a value from the computable numbers
