OK, I need to write this stuff out for the sake of my own understanding. Please excuse my (mathematically formal) language. 

# A Pointless Reconstruction of the Real Numbers
Let $X$ be a space. We're going to construct several different structures on $X$. Two of these are order structures, so we need to be careful with notation to avoid confusion.

## Conceptual Motivation
The typical conceptual and pedagogical way of constructing the reals is as a set of points -- usually the limit points of sequences of rational numbers (at least that's the construction I learned in my graduate analysis class). This presupposes

## The Linear Order

## The Algebraic Structure

## The Measure
