## Monday, July 22
At the beginning of the year, I started my “30-30-30” plan. I managed to make it to around “15-15-15” before falling out of the habit. Even though I only made it about halfway to my goal, I still consider it hugely successful. I managed to lose over 15 pounds! I’d never successfully lost a significant amount of weight before.

## Tuesday, July 23
Since this approach worked so well for me before, I’m going to try rebooting it with a few modifications. So the idea is:
- Pick a short list of goals to accomplish and habits to establish.
- Have well-defined but reasonable long-term and daily/weekly goals.
- Do each task/habit literally every day.
- Regularly re-evaluate the goals, say once per week on Sundays, and adjust as needed.
- Allow myself to take breaks from habits when I hit goals or when it becomes clear that I’ve stopped progressing. But have a plan for when and how I’ll get back to it.
- Track everything in a spreadsheet.
- Share my progress for external accountability.
