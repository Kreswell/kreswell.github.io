## Monday, July 22
At the beginning of the year, I started my “30-30-30” plan. I managed to make it to around “15-15-15” before falling out of the habit. Even though I only made it about halfway to my goal, I still consider it hugely successful. I managed to lose over 15 pounds! I’d never successfully lost a significant amount of weight before.

Since this approach worked so well for me before, I’m going to try rebooting it with a few modifications. So the idea is:
- Pick a short list of goals to accomplish and habits to establish.
- Have well-defined but reasonable long-term and daily/weekly goals.
- Do each task/habit literally every day.
- Regularly re-evaluate the goals, say once per week on Sundays, and adjust as needed.
- Allow myself to take breaks from habits when I hit goals or when it becomes clear that I’ve stopped progressing. But have a plan for when and how I’ll get back to it.
- Track everything in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS5Sk6168ClNcAtyI5rENN3xY5neNYdY1f8DHXItBzUZ2x2FDionPBgePJ6MfcSpsXEhsULJMymCkli/pubhtml).
- Share my progress for external accountability.

So here are my starting goals:
- Weigh.
  - Long-term goal: 187 pounds (just under the lowest weight I hit earlier this year). 
  - Haven’t set a deadline yet.
- Track calories.
  - Although I may not track this week since there’s a collaboration meeting, and snacks like the ones at events like this are [literally](https://media.giphy.com/media/LkcIVUmf1qoUM/giphy-facebook_s.jpg) the hardest foods to track.
- Track steps.
  - No goal yet.
- Stretch.
  - I stopped running regularly about four months ago because I got pretty bad plantar fasciitis in my right foot, and it’s still bothering me. The recommended treatment is a *whole lot* of stretching.
- Write something and post it.
  - I’m starting with a *very* low goal, but the goal of writing every day.
  - I also set a low upper limit, which I broke yesterday and I’m breaking again right now, so I’ll talk more about the reasoning behind this limit tomorrow.
